It allows you to run an instruction using a custom command in your command line interpreter. Using aliases can improve productivity and make the command line easier to use. Setting aliases for repetitive tasks or very complex commands can simplify your workflow and make it more efficient. Shell shortcuts, Git, project-specific aliases or NPM commands are some of the use cases where you can benefit from setting aliases.\\n\\nYou can set an alias like this:\\n\\n```bash\\nalias ll=\'ls -alF\'\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to persist your aliases over the current session, you need to store them in your shell config file, e.g.:`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. This file loads every time you open a new terminal session and it modifies your $PATH variable in the runtime.\\n\\nIf you edit your `.zshrc` file you will need to open a new terminal or do `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the shell cofiguration. If you are using OMZsh you can do it by running `omz reload`.\\n\\nIf you want to change the location of `.zshrc` you need to set it up in `.zprofile` file.\\n\\nIf you don\'t want to use an already cluttered `.zshrc` file and prefer to keep your aliases in a separate file, you can place them in the directory stored in your `ZSH_CUSTOM` system variable. Typically, this variable stores `.oh-my-zsh/custom`, so you can create a Zsh file there and name it as you prefer (e.g., `custom_aliases.zsh`). You can store all your aliases in this file just as you would in `.zshrc`, and your system will load them when `.zshrc` is sourced. This way you separate concerns and keep you personal aliases separated from all the other setups present in `.zshrc`.\\n\\nIf you don\'t use OhMyZsh, by default ZSH only loads specific files (~/.zshrc ~/.zprofile ~/.zshenv ~/.zlogin ~/.zlogout), and you cannot add directly a custom alias file. Instead, you need to write the logic to source the file you want to import. In your `.zshrc` you will need to add the imports like this:\\n\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zsh/aliases.zsh\\nsource ~/.zsh/functions.zsh\\n```\\n\\nOr, maybe if you want to add more files in the future, and don\'t want to constantly modify your `.zshrc` you can do a for loop and import everything in a certain directory:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Source all personal config files\\nfor file in ~/.zsh/*.zsh; do\\n  source \\"$file\\"\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nYou can list all currently defined aliases using the command:\\n\\n```bash\\nalias\\n```\\n\\nOr you can check a specific alias:\\n\\n```bash\\nalias ll\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use `type ll` to know which command will be run. This command shows you if it\'s a shell built in, an alias or a binary.\\n\\nUnsetting an Alias\\nYou can remove an alias with the unalias command:\\n\\n```bsh\\nunalias ll\\n```\\n\\nHow do aliases work?\\n\\nAlias expansion:\\n\\n1. Tokenization\\n2. Alias lookup: The shell first checks if the first word of your command matches an alias in some of your configuration files. If it does, it replaces that word with the alias\'s definition. This process is known as alias expansion.\\n3. Command execution\\n\\n### Alias precedence\\n\\nBy default, alias expansion is disabled in non-interactive shells (like scripts) to avoid unexpected behavior. However, if you have both a shell function and an alias with the same name, the alias will take precedence over the function.\\n\\nThe order of precedence is:\\n\\n- Aliases (highest precedence)\\n- Shell functions\\n- Built-in commands (like echo, cd, etc.)\\n- Programs in PATH (executables)\\n\\n### Aliases in OMZsh\\n\\nOne of the greatest benefits of using OMZsh is all the predefined aliases that it provides. Some of the aliases and scripts you can use in OMZsh are:\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd39 General Command Shortcuts\\n\\n| Alias  | Expands To    | Description                                         |\\n| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `ll`   | `ls -lh`      | Long format with human-readable sizes               |\\n| `la`   | `ls -lha`     | Show hidden files too                               |\\n| `l`    | `ls -l`       | Long format without hidden files                    |\\n| `..`   | `cd ..`       | Move up one directory                               |\\n| `...`  | `cd ../..`    | Move up two directories                             |\\n| `....` | `cd ../../..` | Move up three directories                           |\\n| `c`    | `clear`       | Clear terminal                                      |\\n| `md`   | `mkdir -p`    | Create a directory and parent directories if needed |\\n| `rd`   | `rmdir`       | Remove empty directory                              |\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Other Useful Aliases\\n\\n| Alias   | Expands To    | Description                               |\\n| ------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\\n| `brewu` | `brew update` | Update Homebrew and installed packages    |\\n| `npmi`  | `npm install` | Install dependencies in a Node.js project |\\n| `ping`  | `ping -c 5`   | Ping with 5 packets instead of infinite   |\\n| `yarn`  | `yarn`        | Run Yarn package manager                  |\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd39 Git Aliases (enabled by default in OMZ)\\n\\n| Alias   | Expands To        | Description                        |\\n| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |\\n| `gst`   | `git status`      | Show current repo status           |\\n| `gco`   | `git checkout`    | Checkout a branch                  |\\n| `gcmsg` | `git commit -m`   | Commit with message                |\\n| `gp`    | `git push`        | Push changes                       |\\n| `gl`    | `git pull`        | Pull latest changes                |\\n| `ga`    | `git add`         | Add files to staging               |\\n| `gaa`   | `git add --all`   | Add all files to staging           |\\n| `gcm`   | `git commit -m`   | Commit with message                |\\n| `gcb`   | `git checkout -b` | Create new branch and switch to it |\\n| `gb`    | `git branch`      | List branches                      |\\n| `gd`    | `git diff`        | Show changes                       |\\n\\nYour Git aliases are located in `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh` and you can find the full list at: [OMZ Git aliases](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Oh-My-Zsh_Git.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)."},{"id":"/2024/05/29/setting-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/05/29/setting-up","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-05-29-setting-up.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-29-setting-up.md","title":"Terminal customization","description":"Your environment is your workshop","date":"2024-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Terminal","permalink":"/blog/tags/terminal"},{"label":"MacOS","permalink":"/blog/tags/mac-os"},{"label":"Environment","permalink":"/blog/tags/environment"}],"readingTime":17.26,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dani Vorobiev","title":"Front End Engineer","url":"https://voromir.github.io/about/","imageURL":"https://i.ibb.co/YTPxvhW/voro-profile.png","key":"dani"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["dani"],"tags":["Terminal","MacOS","Environment"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to use alias","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/02/aliases"},"nextItem":{"title":"What is and MDX file?","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/26/mdx-trial"}},"content":"## Your environment is your workshop\\n\\nAs a developer, you will spend some time with your terminal \u2014even if you prefer a GUI. You will run tests, install packages, and use Git, for example. And yes, Git has a GUI, but for some advanced operations you are forced to use the command line. Anyway, the terminal is one of our essential tools, and it\'s nice to have a visually pleasant and powerful terminal instead of a boring and limited default one. I like to think about it like this:\\n\\n> Your environment is your workshop and it is more logical to adapt your workshop to your need rather than the contrary.\\n\\nA good tool, for me, is one that disappears when you use it. It\u2019s not noticeable because it\u2019s just right for the job it\u2019s supposed to do. It\u2019s frictionless and allows you to focus on the work rather than struggling with the tool. That is what I ideally want to achieve in my tooling setup.\\n\\nIn this post, I will explain how I like to configure and personalize my terminal emulator and hopefully some of this tweaks may be useful for you. We will explore as well what a shell is, what a terminal is, the different kinds of shells available, and how to take better advantage of our terminal configuration. All the examples and configurations will be for MacOS system, although most of them can be applied with small adjustments to Linux as well.\\n\\n## \u2018Terminal\u2019 is said in many ways\\n\\nThere are a lot of terms that usually are used to refer to the same thing: Terminal, Shell, Command Line, CLI, Console... But not everything is the same. To better understand what we\'re about to do we need to understand the difference between Shell and Terminal.\\n\\nThe terminal was a device that permitted transcription and entering data in the early computer era. It was an electromechanical device that set and received data from the host, which was called the mainframe. Similarly, nowadays a terminal emulator is a program that provides a text-based interface for human-computer interaction. Different terminal emulators can be GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm, Kitty or Warp (an AI enhanced terminal emulator).\\n\\nOperating systems come with a default terminal emulator, but it\'s easy to install a different one if preferred, specially if you are working on a UNIX-like system. Later on, we will install another terminal emulator to add more functionality to our system.\\n\\n## What\'s the shell?\\n\\nA shell is an interface for interacting with the kernel. Like any other interface, it hides the internal functions of the kernel and only exposes what the user needs. While the term \'shell\' can technically refer to any interface, including a Graphical User Interface (GUI), it is most commonly used to describe a command-line interpreter (CLI). In both cases, the intent is the same: to expose the operating system\u2019s services to users or other programs, with the shell acting as the outermost layer of the operating system. In other words, the shell encapsulates the operating system\u2019s kernel and isolates it from user space. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a shell.\\n\\nThe command-line shell is an interpreter that runs inside the terminal. We can change our terminal emulator\u2014for example, switching from the macOS Terminal to iTerm2\u2014but as long as we don\u2019t change the shell, we will interact with the system in the same way. The terminal emulator is merely an graphical interface for the shell, which is what we are actually interacting with.\\n\\nThe shell (for examples zsh) can run other processes, for example utilities like `grep`, `ls` or `cat`.\\n\\nWhat happens when you run a utility like nano:\\n\\n    1.\\t`ls` (user-level application) doesn\u2019t interact directly with the hardware.\\n    2.\\tIt sends system calls (like `getdents()` or `readdir()`) to the kernel.\\n    3.\\tThe kernel translates these system calls into lower-level instructions and interacts with the file system and the hardware (such as the hard drive or SSD) to retrieve or modify data.\\n    4.\\tThe device driver specific to the storage hardware manages the communication between the kernel and the physical storage device.\\n\\nHere we can see the general schema of the linux architecture here:\\n\\n![Linux_architecture_preview](/img/linux_architecture_preview.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- Maybe delete these two paragraphs --\x3e\\n\\nThe shell has evolved from a basic command interpreter, the Bourne Shell (sh) (1979), through significant improvements with the Bourne Again Shell (bash) (1989), to a highly versatile and feature-rich tool, the Z Shell (zsh) (1990). Many Linux distributions use `bash` as the default shell, while most BSD variants rely on `sh`. Since macOS Catalina (2019), zsh has been the default shell on macOS. If you\'re interested in the evolution of the shells, please, check out this [IBM site](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-linux-shells/).\\n\\nTo summarise it, a terminal emulator is a program that provides a text-based user interface. It sends user inputs to the shell and displays the shell\u2019s outputs. The shell is a command-line interpreter that translates high-level commands into system calls to interact with the kernel (the core of the operating system). The kernel manages system resources, including the CPU, memory, and file system. When a command is executed, the kernel performs the requested operations and returns the result to the shell, which then outputs the result to the terminal emulator for the user to see.\\n\\n## Shell in UNIX-like systems\\n\\nIn UNIX and UNIX-like systems, the current shell is usually defined by the environment variable `SHELL`. This variable specifies the path to the binary of the default shell. Typically, this binary is located in the binary directory `/bin` (for example, `/bin/bash` or `/bin/zsh`) or `/usr/bin`. Since the shell it\'s an application, it can be easly replaced by another one. In Linux you can find the default shell as well using `cat /etc/passwd | grep $USER`.\\n\\nBash and Zsh are maybe the most used shells in UNIX-like systems. Debian, Fedora, Arch and may other linux distributions use Bash as a default shell. Ubuntu, Kali and Parrot use Zsh. As of macOS Catalina (10.15), the default shell for macOS was changed from Bash to Zsh. This change was due to the release of the GPLv3 license, which explicitly disallows the use of GPL-licensed software in a closed system that does not allow the user to modify the software and run it on the machine (see [tivoization](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/tivoization.en.html)).\\n\\nTo find out which shell you are currently using, you can execute:\\n\\n```bash\\necho $SHELL\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to change your shell to another one, you can run:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport SHELL=/bin/bash\\n```\\n\\n`SHELL` variable is temporal and session scoped, which means that it\'s deleted when you terminate the session. Typically, the system sets the `SHELL` environment variable based on the default shell specified in your `/etc/passwd` file. But this setup can be overwritten by the other configurations, like your terminal emulator configuration.\\n\\nIf you want to persist your shell configuration you can use this command instead:\\n\\n```bash\\nchsh -s /bin/zsh\\n```\\n\\nAnd you always can run `bash` to switch to bash and run `zsh` or `exit` to switch to zsh again.\\n\\n## Installing terminal emulator\\n\\nOn macOS, [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/features.html) is the most popular terminal emulator in the dev community. While it resembles a classic console, it offers powerful features like split views, multiple tabs, customizable hotkeys, and extensive configuration options. Accessing the Preferences menu in iTerm reveals a wide range of settings you can adjust to personalize your experience.\\n\\niTerm key features:\\n\\n- Multiple tabs and split view (panes).\\n- Find and filter content in the terminal\\n- Session Management. Reopen all the tabs exactly as they were.\\n- Good theming and customization options.\\n\\n## Terminal Comparison table\\n\\n|            | Search           | Mouse support       | Theming   | Autosuggest                | History   | O.Source | Stability |\\n| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |\\n| **MacOS**  | _Basic_          | _Basic_, no TUI     | _Basic_   | _No_                       | _Basic_   | _no_     | **Great** |\\n| **iTerm2** | **Great**        | **Full**, tmux      | _Good_    | _Add-on_ Shell Integration | _Good_    | _yes_    | **Great** |\\n| **Warp**   | **Great**, block | **Full**, Multiline | **Great** | **Great**, AI powered      | **Great** | _no_     | _Good_    |\\n\\n## Tips for using iTerm2\\n\\nWhen you open a new pane in iTem2 you probably see something like: Last login: `Fri Sep 27 20:11:13 on ttys006`. To know all the sessions you are running, use `who` or `w` commands. In the output you will see all your terminal sessions running and your system process with the uptime, so at least you will have two results.\\n\\nDepending on your default permission settings you can experience the \\"operation not permitted error\\". If this happens to you, you need to go to your MacOS setting, select Privacy and Security and give Full disk access to iTerm2.\\n\\n> WARNING: Modifying the iTerm color scheme may prevent text colors from displaying correctly. If you encounter this issue, check the `Minimum contrast` property in your profile settings and reduce its value.\\n\\nThe terminal in Linux is very powerful. There are even linux distros without Desktop Manager, like Arch Linux.\\n\\n`CMD + Shift + Enter` to maximize the current pane in iTerm2.\\n`CMD + Option + Arrows` or `CMD + [ or ]` to switch between the panes.\\n\\n## Unleash your terminal\\n\\nBy default `zsh` comes with very poor configuration, although it has a lot of potential. For example, you can configure a lot of options with `setopt` command. For example for history you can configure:\\n\\n```bash\\nsetopt APPEND_HISTORY           # Append commands to history file immediately\\nsetopt SHARE_HISTORY            # Share history across multiple terminals\\nsetopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS     # Avoid duplicate history entries\\nsetopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS       # Strip extra spaces\\nsetopt HIST_VERIFY              # Edit before executing history expansion (!stuff)\\n```\\n\\nand for navigation:\\n\\n```bash\\nsetopt AUTO_CD                  # Just type directory name to cd into it\\nsetopt AUTO_PUSHD               # Push to directory stack when cd-ing\\nsetopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS        # Don\'t store duplicate dirs in stack\\nsetopt EXTENDED_GLOB            # Advanced globbing like (**/*.txt)\\n```\\n\\nBut there are much more options and it\'s a burdon to configure everything and install different plugins manually. Theres is a better option which is a configurator. OhMyZsh is the most popular one. It\'a a framework that gives you plugins, themes and configurations right away and makes the setup much easier.\\n\\n_Unleash your terminal_ is the slogan of [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), an open source community driven Zsh manager. This is one of the quickest and easiest ways to get a powerful yet beautiful terminal in a few steps. They promise you:\\n_Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town or your money back!_\\n\\nTo install Oh My Zsh you can:\\n\\n```bash\\nsh -c \\"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\\"\\n```\\n\\nSome of the OMZ themes require special fonts to show icons and special characters in the terminal. To install the fonts you can go to [https://www.nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com) or just use:\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install fonts-powerline\\n```\\n\\nor\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font\\n```\\n\\nThe great thing about ZSH is that the support is great and the community is very active, so you can find lots of documentation, configurations and interesting stuff about it online.\\n\\nThe only problem is that out of the box ZSH is poorly configured and it\'s even worse than bash (reverse search, command history and completion system). But, we have [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), a community configuration that enables all the most useful functionalities to ZSH and gives it a nicer aspect. Oh My Zsh includes aliases, themes and acts like a plugin manager.\\n\\n### OMZ themes\\n\\nYour theme, as many of your other configurations is stored in `.zshrc` file.\\n\\nYou can check the actual theme by printing by `ZSH_THEME` variable.\\n\\nTo switch between themes you can:\\n\\n`omz theme list`\\n\\nand set a theme by:\\n\\n`omz theme set THEME_NAME`\\n\\nYou can preview all the different themes at [https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/themes)\\n\\n> Be aware: Oh My Zsh (OMZ) modifies your `.zshrc`, so there\'s a chance of losing some of your configurations that use this file (for example, SDKMAN!). Luckily, you can find your previous configuration at `~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`.\\n\\nIf you do some mods to your terminal and add some icons and fonts in the iTerm, you won\'t see these changes in your VSCode terminal. You will need to specify the fonts for this terminal and all other terminals you use as well.\\n\\nOnce you select a theme that you like, you can adjust the colors to your preference. Alternatively, you can visit [https://catppuccin.com](https://catppuccin.com) to download a well-built color scheme that you can use across your other code editors.\\n\\n## Autocomplete fix\\n\\nDownload zsh plugins:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions\\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-completions\\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search\\n```\\n\\nAdd this plugins to .zshrc\\n\\n```sh\\nautoload -Uz compinit && compinit\\n\\nplugins=(\\n    git\\n    docker\\n    asdf\\n    zsh-autosuggestions\\n    zsh-completions\\n    zsh-history-substring-search\\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\\n)\\n```\\n\\nyou also can edit the editor section:\\n\\n```sh\\n# Preferred editor for local and remote sessions\\nif [[ -n $SSH_CONNECTION ]]; then\\n   export EDITOR=\'vim\'\\nelse\\n   export EDITOR=\'mvim\'\\nfi\\n```\\n\\n## Further personalization\\n\\n- **Fuzzy Finder**: You can install FZF by `brew install fzf`. This allows you to fuzzy find in all your documents. But if you use Warp, you don\'t need it because it comes out of the box with the same functionality, allowing you to easily search through files with fuzzy matching. I use `nvim $(fzf --preview=\\"bat --color=always {}\\")` alias to preview files while I am searching and open the selected file pressing enter.\\n\\n- **Zoxide**: is a powerful tool designed to streamline your workflow with customizable, fast, and interactive search and file navigation. It integrates well with your shell, improving how you move between directories. Using Zoxide you don\'t need to remember the exact name of your directories: just type some word and it will bring you there. If there are more directories with same words you can use tab and preview in a fuzzy finder different options and select the one you want.\\n\\n- **Yazi**: is a terminal file system explorer that simplifies and enhances the way you work with CLI applications. It offers features such as advanced autocomplete, custom shortcuts, and efficient command navigation. Yazi is especially useful when dealing with complex directory structures, eliminating the need to repeatedly use `cd` and `ls`. With Yazi, you can preview the files you select (you may need `imgcat` to preview pictures), and pressing `.` will reveal all your dotfiles. You can also \\"yank\\" and paste files using `y` and `p`. Additionally, Yazi supports Vim motions in its interface, making it a perfect fit for Vim or Neovim users.\\n\\n- **Starship**: is a fast and customizable prompt for any shell. It allows you to configure your prompt to display information like Git status, system performance, time, and much more in a clean and minimalistic style, without slowing down your terminal. It\'s highly modular, making it easy to add and adjust functionality.\\n\\n## Aliases\\n\\n### A Gotcha with Oh My Zsh and AUTO_CD\\n\\nIf you are using Oh My Zsh or Zsh with AUTO_CD enabled, and you try to enter a directory by typing its name (e.g., git), but there is a program with the same name (e.g., /opt/homebrew/bin/git), the program will be executed instead of changing directories.\\n\\nThis happens because Zsh prioritizes executables in your PATH over the auto-cd feature. To access a directory that shares a name with a program in your PATH, you must use the cd command explicitly. Alternatively, you can disable the AUTO_CD feature by running `unsetopt AUTO_CD`.\\n\\n## What\'s up with Tmux\\n\\nTmux, which stands for Terminal MUltipleXer, is another way of doing things. With tmux you can create a session in a machine, run some commands, detach from it, start another session to run other processes and then attach back to the first one. You can even detach from an SSH session and attach to it from somewhere else using another machine. This is very useful if you frequently use SSH (Secure Shell protocol) to connect to remote machines. Tmux can be customized and there are a lot of community-based setings like [Oh My Tmux!](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) that offers a quick setup with the most used features and a nice appearence.\\n\\nA lot of people use TMux as a tiling window manager, but iTerm2 and other modern terminal emulators can manage panes in a way similar to TMux. So, if you\'re already using a custom terminal emulator and don\'t need session persistence, you might not need TMux.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you\'re accustomed to TMux\u2019s way of managing windows and want to make it portable across different machines or need session persistence, then TMux can be the right choice for you.\\n\\nLuckily, iTerm2 integrates with TMux, and you can find the details by going to Settings > General > TMux.\\n\\n## Don\'t repeat yourself: automate it!\\n\\nAs you can see, it\'s a long process. But, if you have a configuration that you really like, you can automate it. One way to do it is to use a script. There are multiple scripts on the internet for personalization, like this one for Parrot Linux with bspwm: https://github.com/xJackSx/BSPWMparrot. Another idea is using ansible to automate the installation. This is out of the scope of this article, but there\'s something easier we can do to organise and save all our configuration files.\\n\\nFiles like `.zshrc`, .`oh-my-zsh`, .`gitconfig`, and `.config/nvim/`, also known as dotfiles, reside in your home directory, and over time, you accumulate quite a lot of them. However, when setting up a new machine, you don\u2019t have all the configurations you\'ve built over the years.\\n\\nTo transfer this configuration to a new machine, you can create a dotfiles repository. To do this, create a new folder in your home directory (for example, called \\"Dotfiles\\"), move the files you want to track into it, and then create symbolic links back to the home directory so that programs can read them. The sequence of commands can look something like this:\\n\\n```powershell\\nmkdir -p ~/dotfiles\\nmv ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/\\nln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc\\n```\\n\\nIf you don\u2019t want to create all the symlinks one by one, you can use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to automate the process. Once you have stored all the necessary configuration files in your dotfiles directory and created the links, you can add this directory to a Git repository to keep track of your configuration files.\\n\\nWhen you modify any configuration in the files within your home directory, the actual linked files in your dotfiles directory will be updated as well, allowing you to commit and push these changes to the remote repository. Now, anytime you get a new machine to setup, you can just pull the files from the remote repository and create the symlinks in your new system.\\n\\nOne more thing you can add to this directory is a list of all the packages you have installed with Brew. For that, you can run the following command:\\n\\n```powershell\\nbrew bundle dump --describe\\n```\\n\\nThis will generate a dump file called Brewfile with all your packages in your working directory. Keeping track of this file will help you to reinstall all the needed software in your new machine. To install all the packages from a Brewfile, the only thing you need to do is run `brew bundle install` in the same directory where you Brewfile is located. You can find more info about how to use `brew bundle` at [Brew Bundle Brewfile Tips](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f).\\n\\n## Downsides of using iTerm + OMZ\\n\\niTerm2 and OMZ are very powerful tools, and their configuration is quite straightforward. However, they have their own drawbacks. One of the major downsides of this setup is speed. iTerm is an excellent terminal emulator, but to be honest, it\u2019s not the fastest one. There are other terminals that are more performance-focused, such as WezTerm, Kitty, and Alacritty. You can see benchmark results in this [tweet](https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1871663119187280293).\\n\\nOn the other hand, OMZ also increases the TTI (time to interactive). Depending on your terminal usage, this may or may not be a significant issue for you. Personally, it\u2019s not a problem for me. But if you want a blazing-fast terminal that lets you open and close multiple windows with almost no delay, you should probably try one of those alternatives. As you can see in the performance benchmarks, the more features a terminal emulator has, the slower it becomes. So, it\u2019s up to you to decide where to draw the line between performance and features.\\n\\nAnother drawback of iTerm2 is that it\'s not designed to be configured primarily via a config file. While it\'s possible, the configuration file is not as readable as `YAML` or `TOML`, which many other terminal emulators use. So, if you want to automate terminal configuration and rely on a config file, iTerm2 might not be the best option."},{"id":"/2024/05/26/mdx-trial","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/05/26/mdx-trial","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-05-26-mdx-trial.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-26-mdx-trial.mdx","title":"What is and MDX file?","description":"Empowering the text","date":"2024-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"mdx","permalink":"/blog/tags/mdx"},{"label":"markdown","permalink":"/blog/tags/markdown"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":2.16,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dani Vorobiev","title":"Front End Engineer","url":"https://voromir.github.io/about/","imageURL":"https://i.ibb.co/YTPxvhW/voro-profile.png","key":"dani"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["dani"],"tags":["mdx","markdown","docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Terminal customization","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/29/setting-up"}},"content":"import BouncingBall from \\"../src/components/BouncingBall\\";\\nimport LiveCodeExample from \\"../src/components/LiveCodeExample\\";\\n\\n\\n## Empowering the text\\n\\nMarkdown is a tool that allows you to write using an easy-to-write plain text format, that is converted to structurally valid HTML.\\nOriginally, it was intended to easly create content for the web. And it does it great. It\'s very intuitive so you can start using it just after learning the basic syntax.\\nOnce you write your plain text with proper Markdown syntax, the Markdown parser will convert it into valid HTML that reflects the intended layout and style.\\nAnd lots of great platforms are powered by markdown syntax: Obsidian, Trello, Notion, Stack Overflow, GitHub,\\nJekyll, Docusaurus and much more. So if you\'re getting in the software development world, you will be using\\nmarkdown for sure.\\n\\nWith Markdown youcan write text, lists, tables, code blocks, images, links, and much more. Let\'s put here\\nan example of each one:\\n\\n> Text that is a quote\\n\\n1. First item\\n2. Second item\\n\\n```javascript\\nconsole.log(\\"Hello, world!\\");\\n```\\n\\n[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is a project for easily building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites.\\n\\nThese are some of the basic features of markdown. But there\'s much more. You can finde more detailed information\\nin the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and in the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\\n\\n## From MD to MDX\\n\\nBut what if you want to add some interactivity to your markdown file? You can use MDX for that. MDX is a markdown\\nfile that can contain JSX code. Isn\'t that great? If you use React, you know that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML elements\\ninside your JavaScript code. Once you get used to it, it gets really easy to write pages with this syntax. So with the MDX basically you can write React\\ncomponents inside your markdown file. Here goes an example:\\n\\n<BouncingBall />\\n\\nWhich in the code looks like this:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport BouncingBall from \\"../src/components/BouncingBall\\";\\n\\n// All the markdown content\\n\\n<BouncingBall />;\\n```\\n\\nBasically, you just import the component and use it as you would use it in a React component. You can also declare variables and pass props to the components.\\nSo you can create a very interactive page with just a markdown file.\\n\\n## More cool stuff!\\n\\nBeing able to use JSX in markdown files gives you a lot of power. You can create almost anything you want. You can create a live code editor, for example. Let\'s have a look:\\n\\n<LiveCodeExample />\\n\\nHow cool is that? You can write code and see the result in real-time. And you can do this in a markdown file."}]}}')}}]);
