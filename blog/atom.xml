<p>As a developer, you gonna spend some time with your terminal. Even if you like GUI. You will run tests, install packages and use Git, for exaple. Terminal is one of our main tools and it's nice to have a visually pleasant and powerful terminal instead of borring and limited default one. In this post I will explain how I like to configure and personalize my Terminal and the main concepts thet we need to know about: what is the shell, what is the terminal, what is a CLI, what different kinds of shells do we have and how to take the better advantage of our terminal and shell configuration. You can think about it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your environment is your workshop and it is more logical to adapt your workshop to your need rather than the countrary.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="terminal-or-shell">Terminal or Shell?<a href="https://voromir.github.io/blog/2024/05/29/setting-up#terminal-or-shell" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Terminal or Shell?" title="Direct link to Terminal or Shell?">​</a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of terms that usually are used to refer to the same thing: Terminal, Shell, Command Line, CLI, Console... But not everything is the same. To better understand what we're about to do we need to understand the difference between Shell and Terminal.</p>
<p>The terminal was a device that permitted transciption and entering data in the early computer era. It was an elecromechanical device that sended and recieved data form the host, which was called the mainframe. Similarly, nowaday a terminal emulator is a program that provides a text-based interface for the human-computer interaction. Different terminal emulators can be GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm, Kitty o Warp (an AI enhanced terminal emulator). Operating systems come with default terminar emulator, but it's easy to install whatever terminal emulator you like.</p>
<p>You have tmux as well, which is an abbreviation of Terminal MUltipleXer. With tmux you can create a session in a machine, run some commands, deattach from it, start another session to run other processes and then attach back to the first one. You can even detach from an SSH session and attach to it from somwhere else using another machine. This is very useful if you are usually using SSH (Secure Shell protocol) to connect to remote machines. iTerm integrates tmux and you can find the details going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Tmux.</p>
<p>You can use TMux as a Tiling Window Manager, but there's a lot of other options.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-shell">What's the shell?<a href="https://voromir.github.io/blog/2024/05/29/setting-up#whats-the-shell" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's the shell?" title="Direct link to What's the shell?">​</a></h2>
<p>A shell is an interface to interact with the kernel. As any other interface, it hides the internal function of the kernel and only brings the user what is needed. The shell can be a GUI (Graphical User Interface) or a command line interpreter. In both cases the intend is the same: to expose the operating system services to the human or to other programs, being the shell the outmost layer of the operating system. In other words, the shell encapsulates the operating system kernel and isolates it from the user space. That's why it's called a shell.</p>
<p>The command-line shell is the interpreter that runs inside the terminal. We can change our terminal emulator, for example from the MacOs terminal to iTerm2, but as long as we don't change the Shell, we will be able to interact in the same way with the new terminal. The terminal is only and interface for the Shell which is what you are interacting with. Indeed, Sh Shell was run on the physical terminals, providing the same core functionality that modern shells and terminal emulators carry forward today. Sh Shell was a great improvement and gave a grat power to UNIX introducing Scripting, Redirection, Variables and Control Structures.</p>
<p>What happens when you run a utility like nano:</p>
<ol>
<li>nano (the user application) doesn’t interact directly with the hardware.</li>
<li>It sends system calls (like open() or read()) to the kernel.</li>
<li>The kernel translates these system calls into lower-level instructions and interacts with the file system and the hardware (such as the hard drive or SSD) to retrieve or modify data.</li>
<li>The device driver specific to the storage hardware manages the communication between the kernel and the physical storage device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we can see the general schema of the linux architecture here:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Linux_architecture_preview" src="https://voromir.github.io/assets/images/linux_architecture_preview-e67ee046c2ee4534aa24f10a0c1fa975.png" width="2128" height="1224" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The shell does not communicate directly with the kernel. Instead, it interacts with the kernel through the kernel API or system calls. System calls act as a bridge between the user-space (where the shell runs) and the kernel-space (where the kernel operates).</p>
<p>The shell is defined by the environment variable <code>SHELL</code>. This variable specifies the path to the binary of the default shell. Typically, this binary is located in the binary directory <code>/bin</code>, so it could be, for example, <code>/bin/bash</code> or /bin/zsh. Since the shell it's an application, it can be easly replaced by another one.</p>
<p>To find out which shell you are currently using, you can execute:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">echo $SHELL</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>If you want to change your shell to another one, you can run:</p>

<p><code>SHELL</code> variable is temporal and session scoped, which means that it's deleted when you terminate the session. Typically, the system sets the <code>SHELL</code> environment variable based on the default shell specified in your <code>/etc/passwd</code> file. But this setup can be overwritten by the other configurations, like your terminal emulator configuration.</p>
<p>If you want to persist your shell configuration you can use this command instead:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">chsh -s /bin/zsh</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>And you allways can run <code>bash</code> to switch to bash and run <code>zsh</code> or <code>exit</code> to switch to zsh again.</p>

<p>To summarise it, a terminal emulator is a program that provides a text-based user interface. It sends user inputs to the shell and displays the shell’s outputs. The shell is a command-line interpreter that translates high-level commands into system calls to interact with the kernel (the core of the operating system). The kernel manages system resources, including the CPU, memory, and file system. When a command is executed, the kernel performs the requested operations and returns the result to the shell, which then outputs the result to the terminal emulator for the user to see.</p>

<p>When you open a new pane in iTem2 you probably se something like: Last login: <code>Fri Sep 27 20:11:13 on ttys006</code>. To know all the sessions you are running, use <code>who</code> or <code>w</code> commands. In the output you will se al your terminal sessions runnins and your system process with the uptime, so at least you will have two results.</p>
<p>Depending on your default permission settings you can experience the "operation not permitted error". If this happens to you, you need to go to your MacOS setting, select Privacy and Security and give Full disk acess to iTerm2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: Modifying the iTerm color scheme may prevent text colors from displaying correctly. If you encounter this issue, check the <code>Minimum contrast</code> property in your profile settings and reduce its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The terminal in Linux is very powerful. There are even linux distros without Desktop Manager, like Arch Linux.</p>
<p><code>CMD + Shift + Enter</code> to maximize the current pane in iTerm2.
<code>CMD + Option + Arrows</code> or <code>CMD + [ or ]</code> to switch between the panes.</p>

<p>We often hear about UNIX based systems and we know that MacOS and Linux are UNIX based systems. But what is really a UNIX system? Indeed, UNIX has a lot of history behind</p>
<p>As of macOS Catalina (10.15), the default shell for macOS was changed from Bash to Zsh. This change was due to the release of the GPLv3 license, which explicitly disallows the use of GPL-licensed software in a closed system that does not allow the user to modify the software and run it on the machine.</p>

<p>Cloud shell: is a browser-based command-line interface provided by cloud service providers to manage cloud resources, run scripts, debug code, and experiment with new tools or technologies. It's common to use cloud shell to interact with services like DynamoDB, S3, and BigQuery.</p>
<p>Reverse Shell: A reverse shell is a type of cyberattack technique where an attacker establishes a connection back to a compromised victim's machine. This connection allows the attacker to gain remote access and execute commands on the victim's system, essentially taking control of the machine. It's not a technology in itself but rather a method used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.</p>

<p>The great thing about ZSH is that the support is great and the community is very active, so you can file lots of documentation, cofigurations and interesting stuff about it online.</p>
<p>The only problem is that out of the box ZSH is poorly configured and it's even worse than bash (reverse search, command history, completion system). But, we have <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oh My Zsh</a>, a community configuration that enables all the most useful functionalities to ZSH and gives it a nicer aspect. Oh My Zsh includes aliases, themes and acts like a plugin manager.</p>

<p>Your theme, as many of your other configurations is stored in <code>.zshrc</code> file.</p>
<p>You can check the actual theme by printing by <code>ZSH_THEME</code> variable.</p>
<p>To switch between themes you can:</p>
<p><code>omz theme list</code></p>
<p>and set theme by:</p>
<p><code>omz theme set THEME_NAME</code></p>
<p>Yo can preview all the different themes at <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/themes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be aware: Oh My Zsh (OMZ) modifies your <code>.zshrc</code>, so there's a chance of losing some of your configurations that use this file (for example, SDKMAN!). Luckily, you can find your previous configuration at <code>~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do some mods to you terminal and add some icons and fonts in the iTerm, you won't see this changes in your VSCode terminal. You will need to specify the fonts for this terminal and all other terminals you use as well.</p>
<p>Once you select a theme that you like, you can adjust the colors to your preference.

<p>If you want to persist your aliases over the current session, you need to store them in your shell config file, e.g.:<code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code>. This file loads every time you open a new terminal session and it modifies your $PATH variable in the runtime.</p>
<p>If you edit your <code>.zshrc</code> file you will need to open a new terminal or do <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> to reload the shell cofiguration. If you are using OMZsh you can do it by running <code>omz reload</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the location of <code>.zshrc</code> you need to set it up in <code>.zprofile</code> file.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use an already cluttered <code>.zshrc</code> file and prefer to keep your aliases in a separate file, you can place them in the directory stored in your <code>ZSH_CUSTOM</code> system variable. Typically, this variable stores <code>.oh-my-zsh/custom</code>, so you can create a Zsh file there and name it as you prefer (e.g., custom_aliases.zsh). You can store all your aliases in this file just as you would in .zshrc, and your system will load them when <code>.zshrc</code> is sourced.</p>
<p>You can list all currently defined aliases using the command:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">alias</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>type ll</code> to know which command will be run. This command shows you if it's a shell built in, an alias or a binary.</p>

<p>How alias work?
Alias expansion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tockenization</li>
<li>Alias lookup: The shell first checks if the first word of your command matches an alias in some of your configuration files. If it does, it replaces that word with the alias's definition. This process is known as alias expansion.</li>
<li>Command execution</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alias-precedence">Alias Precedence<a href="https://voromir.github.io/blog/2024/05/29/setting-up#alias-precedence" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alias Precedence" title="Direct link to Alias Precedence">​</a></h3>
<p>By default, alias expansion is disabled in non-interactive shells (like scripts) to avoid unexpected behavior. However, if you have both a shell function and an alias with the same name, the alias will take precedence over the function.</p>
<p>The order of precedence is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aliases (highest precedence)</li>
<li>Shell functions</li>
<li>Built-in commands (like echo, cd, etc.)</li>
<li>Programs in PATH (executables)</li>

<p>Your git aliases are located in <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh</code> and you can find the full list at: <a href="https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Oh-My-Zsh_Git.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OMZ Git aliases</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-gotcha-with-oh-my-zsh-and-auto_cd">A Gotcha with Oh My Zsh and AUTO_CD<a href="https://voromir.github.io/blog/2024/05/29/setting-up#a-gotcha-with-oh-my-zsh-and-auto_cd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Gotcha with Oh My Zsh and AUTO_CD" title="Direct link to A Gotcha with Oh My Zsh and AUTO_CD">​</a></h3>
<p>If you are using Oh My Zsh or Zsh with AUTO_CD enabled, and you try to enter a directory by typing its name (e.g., git), but there is a program with the same name (e.g., /opt/homebrew/bin/git), the program will be executed instead of changing directories.</p>
<p>This happens because Zsh prioritizes executables in your PATH over the auto-cd feature. To access a directory that shares a name with a program in your PATH, you must use the cd command explicitly. Alternatively, you can disable the AUTO_CD feature by running <code>unsetopt AUTO_CD</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's a long process. But, if you have a configuration that you really like, you can automate it. One way to do it is to use a script. There are multiple scripts on the internet for personalization, like this one for Parrot Linux with bspwm: <a href="https://github.com/xJackSx/BSPWMparrot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/xJackSx/BSPWMparrot</a>. Another idea is using ansible to automate the installation. This is out of the scope of this article, but there's something easier we can do to organise and save all our configuration files.</p>
<p>Files like <code>.zshrc</code>, .<code>oh-my-zsh</code>, .<code>gitconfig</code>, and .c<code>onfig/nvim/</code>, also known as dotfiles, reside in your home directory, and over time, you accumulate quite a lot of them. However, when setting up a new machine, you don’t have all the configurations you've built over the years.</p>
<p>To transfer this configuration to a new machine, you can create a dotfiles repository. To do this, create a new folder in your home directory (for example, called "Dotfiles"), move the files you want to track into it, and then create symbolic links back to the home directory so that programs can read them. The sequence of commands can look something like this:</p>
<div class="language-powershell codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-powershell codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">mkdir -p ~/dotfiles</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">mv ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>If you don’t want to create all the symlinks one by one, you can use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU Stow</a> to automate the process. Once you have stored all the necessary configuration files in your dotfiles directory and created the links, you can add this directory to a Git repository to keep track of your configuration files.</p>
<p>When you modify any configuration in the files within your home directory, the actual linked files in your dotfiles directory will be updated as well, allowing you to commit and push these changes to the remote repository. Now, anytime you got a new machine to setup, you can just pull the files from the remote repository and create the symlinks in your new system.</p>
<p>One more thing you can add to this directory are all the packets that you have in Brew. For that, you can run the following command:</p>
<div class="language-powershell codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-powershell codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">brew bundle dump --describe</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This will generate a dump file called Brewfile with all your packages in your working directory. Keeping track of this file will help you to reinstall al the needed software in your new machine. To install all the packages from a Brewfile the only thing you need to do is to run <code>brew bundle install</code> in the same directory where you Brewfile is located. You can find more info about how to use <code>brew bundle</code> at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brew Bundle Brewfile Tips</a>.</p>

<p>Neofetch and lolcat. Now that you setted up a nice terminal with your custom prompot and your favourite shell is time to show-off. Neofetch is a improved screenfetch that displays system information in a esthetic way and customizable format. You can use it if you don't remember your machine's specs or just to showcase your terminal configuration. You can edit the config in <code>.config/neofetch/config.conf.</code> Lolcat, on the other hand, is a modified cat that displays text in playful rainbow color. You can pipe your neofetch into it or any other thext output.</p>]]></content>

<p>Markdown is a tool that allows you to write using an easy-to-write plain text format, that is converted to structurally valid HTML.
Originally, it was intended to easly create content for the web. And it does it great. It's very intuitive so you can start using it just after learning the basic syntax.
Once you write your plain text with proper Markdown syntax, the Markdown parser will convert it into valid HTML that reflects the intended layout and style.
And lots of great platforms are powered by markdown syntax: Obsidian, Trello, Notion, Stack Overflow, GitHub,
Jekyll, Docusaurus and much more. So if you're getting in the software development world, you will be using
markdown for sure.</p>
<p>With Markdown youcan write text, lists, tables, code blocks, images, links, and much more. Let's put here
an example of each one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text that is a quote</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>First item</li>
<li>Second item</li>
</ol>
<div class="language-javascript codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-javascript codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">.</span><span class="token method function property-access" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">log</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">(</span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p><a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> is a project for easily building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites.</p>
<p>These are some of the basic features of markdown. But there's much more. You can finde more detailed information
in the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown Guide</a> and in the <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Markdown Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-md-to-mdx">From MD to MDX<a href="https://voromir.github.io/blog/2024/05/26/mdx-trial#from-md-to-mdx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From MD to MDX" title="Direct link to From MD to MDX">​</a></h2>
<p>But what if you want to add some interactivity to your markdown file? You can use MDX for that. MDX is a markdown
file that can contain JSX code. Isn't that great? If you use React, you know that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML elements
inside your JavaScript code. Once you get used to it, it gets really easy to write pages with this syntax. So with the MDX basically you can write React
components inside your markdown file. Here goes an example:</p>
<div class="bouncing-ball-container"><div class="ball"></div></div>
<p>Which in the code looks like this:</p>
<div class="language-jsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-jsx codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token keyword module" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">import</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token imports maybe-class-name">BouncingBall</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword module" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">from</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">"../src/components/BouncingBall"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(98, 114, 164)">// All the markdown content</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&lt;</span><span class="token tag class-name" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">BouncingBall</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)"> </span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">/&gt;</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Basically, you just import the component and use it as you would use it in a React component. You can also declare variables and pass props to the components.
So you can create a very interactive page with just a markdown file.</p>

<p>Being able to use JSX in markdown files gives you a lot of power. You can create almost anything you want. You can create a live code editor, for example. Let's have a look:</p>
